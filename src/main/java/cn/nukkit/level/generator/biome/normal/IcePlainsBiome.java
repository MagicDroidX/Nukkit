 * These biomes are a part of SnowyBiomes.
 * Biomes: Ice Plains and Ice Plains Spikes.
 *
 * Info:
 * An expansive, flat biome with a huge amount of snow.
 * All sources of water exposed to the sky are frozen over.
 * Sugar cane will generate in this biome, but can become uprooted when chunks load as the water sources freeze to ice.
 * There are very few natural oak and spruce trees in this biome.
 * It has a lower chance of spawning passive mobs during world generation than other biomes (7% versus 10%), however it is one of the few biomes where Polar bears and Strays spawn.
 * Due to the biome's size, snow and ice cover, and scarcity of wood and animals, initial survival becomes difficult in comparison to other biomes.
 * This is one of only two biomes where igloos naturally generate.
